# 📊 SociaLyze — Social Media Content Analysis (Vanilla JS Project)

This project is a small work created to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. The design was not the main focus, as the primary goal was to improve JavaScript logic and practice core web development concepts.
